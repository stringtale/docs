description: Explanation on how to integrate Stringtale in your front-end using React
---

## React

Stringtale is fully compatible with React as long as you're using a back-end server to handle the communication with Stringtale.
Currently we support NextJS (both the App router and the legacy pages router) as well as Express.js as back-ends, with more coming
in the future.

## Implementation

The implementation of Stringtale in React is very flexible. You're not limited to just using plain text. It also supports string
interpolation, rich text as well as custom 

### Basic usage

In its most basic form Stringtale can be used anywhere you have static text that you want your clients to be able to edit.
Here's an example of how you can use Stringtale to change the text of a button.

```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";

<button>
  <Value name="apps.web.src.index.header.try_now">
    Try now
  </Value>
</button>
```

### String interpolation

```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";

const groceries = ["Bananas", "Pineapple", "Kiwi"]

<span>
  <Value
    name="apps.web.src.groceries.items"
    format={{
      count: groceries.length
    }}
  >
    {`Your grocery list contains {count} items`}
  </Value>
</span>
```

### Text formatting


```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";

<Value
  name="apps.web.src.counter.items"
  format={{
    b: (c) => <Text bold>{c}</Text>,
    b2: (c) => <RedText bold>{c}</RedText>
  }}
>
  {`<b>Alle methodes:</b> {count} <b2>items</b2>`}
</Value>
```

### String interpolation and text formatting
```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";
<Value
  name="apps.web.src.counter.items"
  format={{
    b: (c) => <Text bold>{c}</Text>,
    count: hits?.[0]?.length
  }}
>
  {`<b>Alle methodes:</b> {count} items`}
</Value>
```
Supported tags:


By default HTML tags are supported by importing them, if you want to use custom formatting, this can be done through
```tsx

import { tags, Value } from "@stringtale/react"

<Value format={{ ...tags, yourTag: (c) => <SomeTag>{c}</SomeTag> }}>{`<b>Bold test</b> <yourTag>asdfasdf</yourTag>`}</Value>

```
