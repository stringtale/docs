description: Explanation on how to integrate Stringtale in your front-end using React
---

## React

Stringtale is fully compatible with React as long as you're using a back-end server to handle the communication with Stringtale.
Currently we support NextJS (both the App router and the legacy pages router) as well as Express.js as back-ends, with more coming
in the future.

## Implementation

The implementation of Stringtale in React is very flexible. You're not limited to just using plain text. It also supports string
interpolation, formatting as well as custom components.

For all usages Stringtale uses FormatJS under the hood. So if you're unsure about how to use it, please check out
the [FormatJS documentation](https://formatjs.io/docs/core-concepts/icu-syntax/).

### Basic usage

In its most basic form Stringtale can be used anywhere you have static text that you want your clients to be able to edit.
Here's an example of how you can use Stringtale to change the text of a button.

```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";

<button>
  <Value name="apps.web.src.index.header.try_now">
    Try now
  </Value>
</button>
```

**The resulting output would be:**

---

[Try now]

---

### String interpolation

Stringtale isn't limited to plain text. It also supports string interpolation.

```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";

const groceries = ["Bananas", "Pineapple", "Kiwi"]

<span>
  <Value
    name="apps.web.src.groceries.items"
    format={{
      count: groceries.length
    }}
  >
    {`Your grocery list contains {count} items.`}
  </Value>
</span>
```

**The resulting output would be:**

---

Your grocery list contains 3 items.

---

### Using inline components

It's also possible to use inline components in your strings. This can be useful when you want to use your own React components or links inside your strings.

```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";
import Link from "next/link"

<Value
  name="apps.web.src.storebanner.description"
  format={{
    bold: (c) => <Text bold>{c}</Text>,
    link: (c) => <Link href={Routes.StorePage()}>{c}</Link>
  }}
>
  {`For our <b>merchandise</b> check out the <link>store</link>.`}
</Value>
```

**The resulting output would be:**

---

For our **merchandise** check out the <ins>store</ins>.

---


### String interpolation and text formatting combined

String interlopation and text formatting combined can be used to create more complex strings.

```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";

const hits = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
<Value
  name="apps.web.src.counter.items"
  format={{
    bold: (c) => <Text bold>{c}</Text>,
    count: hits.length
  }}
>
  {`Result: <bold>{count} items</bold>.`}
</Value>
```

---

Result **9 items**.

---



### Using standard HTML tags

To simplify the formatting of your strings, we've included an easy way to import standard HTML tags for you to use. They're usage is slightly
different depending on wether it's a self closing tag such as `<br>` or not such as `<b></b>`.

```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";
<Value
  name="apps.web.src.counter.items"
  format={{
    ...htmlEmptyTags,
    ...htmlFormatTags,
  }}
>
  {`This is a sentence with <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> and <u>underlined</u>
  text.It also has a linebreak{br}in the middle.`}
</Value>
```

**The resulting output would be:**

---

This is a sentence with **bold**, *italic* and <ins>underlined</ins> text. It also has a linebreak\
in the middle.
