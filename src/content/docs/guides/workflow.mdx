Getting started with new technology can be challenging. The following workflow has proven helpful for people
to incorporate Stringtale into their workflow.

## For developers

### Initial setup and usage

To get started, you have to integrate Stringtale into your code base and deploy it to your test / preview environment.

1. Use `stringtale init` to integrate Stringtale into a new or existing project. For the full guide on how to use this command, please refer to the [getting started](/guides/getting-started).
2. Create a `API key` in the [Stringtale Dashboard](https://stringtale.com/app/projects).
3. Deploy your project to your test/preview environment.
4. Let your client make the changes they require.
5. Either use `stringtale pull` to pull their changes to your source code or let our [GitHub action](/usage/github-action) create a pull request
   on your next commit.
6. Review the changes and accept them to your code base, ready for release with the next update.

### Adding new static text to your project

At some during the development of your project you'll have to add new static text to your project. The easiest way to achieve this is by using
the [ESlint plugin](/usage/eslint-plugin) or using the [VS Code extension](/usage/vscode-extension).

1. Create your component with the static text.
2. Select the text you've just added.
3. Use the plugin / extension for your editor to wrap the text in a `<Value>` tag with an automatically generated `name` attribute.
4. The `name` attribute will gets used to store updates in the Stringtale's database and retrieve those once the text has changed.
    <Aside type="caution" title="Changing the name attribute">
      You can alter a `<Value>`'s `name` attribute if preferred.
      We recommend you only change it on initial implementation to
      avoid synchronization issues.
    </Aside>

### Pulling in changes that have been made externally
1. Use `stringtale pull` to pull in the latest changes from Stringtale.
2. You'll notice that any updated `<Value>` tags will now have a `version` attribute. This is what the CLI uses to deterine if the text
has to be updated or not. You should not update the `version` attribute manually.
3. Once you've reviewd the changes, you can commit them to repository, ready for the next update.

### Manually updatting text in your code base
When using Stringtale, you're not limited to text changes through the browser. It's still entirely possible to make changes directly in your code base.
In order to change the text inside your code base, you only have to change the text in your code base and commit it to your repository. There's no need
to manually add or update the `version` attribute. The version attribute is only used to determine if changes from outside the repository have been made
and need to be pulled in. 


## For your clients

For clients we've streamlined the experience by offering them browser extension. This is the user-friendly alternative to appending
`?stringtale` to the URL. This also has the added benefit of not having to reload the page.

### Editing static text

1. Install the browser extension.
2. Navigate to the project's test / preview environment.
3. Click the Stringtale button in the toolbar.
4. All the field's you've defined as editable with the `<Value>` tag will now become editable and the Stringtale GUI will appear.
5. Your client makes their required changes, saving them as they go. Ready for your to deploy with the next update.
<Aside type="tip">
   It's highly recommended you lock down your test / preview environment through some form authentication (i.e. basic auth),
   as there's no user authentication for text edits in Stringtale at this moment.
