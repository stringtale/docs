Getting started with new technology can be challenging. The following workflow has proven helpful for people
to incorporate Stringtale into their workflow.

## For developers

### Initial setup and usage

To get started, you have to integrate Stringtale into your code base and deploy it to your test / preview environment.

1. Use `stringtale init` to integrate Stringtale into a new or existing project.
2. Create a `API key` in the [Stringtale Dashboard](https://stringtale.com/app/projects).
3. Deploy your project to your test/preview environment.
4. Let your client make the changes they require.
5. Either use `stringtale pull` to pull their changes to your source code or let our [GitHub action](/usage/github-action) create a pull request
   on your next commit.
6. Review the changes and accept them to your code base, ready to be released with the next update.

### Adding new static text to your project

At some during the development of your project you'll have to add new static text to your project. Doing so has been streamlined by using
the plugin / extension for your editor.

1. Write the static text as you normally would.
2. Select the text you've just added.
3. Use the plugin / extension for your editor to wrap the text in a `<Value>` tag with an automatically generated `key` attribute.
4. The `key` attribute will be used to store updates in the Stringtale's database and retrieve those once the text has changed.
    <Aside type="caution" title="Changing the key attribute">
      You can alter a `<Value>`'s `key` attribute if preferred.
      We however recommend you only change it on initial implementation to
      avoid synchronization issues.

## For clients

For clients we've streamlined the experience by offering them browser extension. This is the user-friendly alternative to appending
`?stringtale` to the URL. This also has the added benefit of not having to reload the page.

### Editing static text

1. Install the browser extension.
2. Navigate to the project's test / preview environment.
3. Click the Stringtale button in the toolbar.
4. All the field's you've defined as editable with the `<Value>` tag will now become editable and the Stringtale GUI will appear.

     There's currently no user authentication for text edits in Stringtale. It's therefor recommended to lock down
     your test / preview environment through other means. For example using basic auth.

5. They make their required changes, saving them as they go.
   <Aside>
    Text updates will not be automatically applied to the website once your clients save them.
    They'll be ready for you to implement at your convenience with the next update.
