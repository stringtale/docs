You're looking to integrate Stringtale into your (existing) project? You've come to the right place! This guide will lead
you through the required steps and get you up and running in minutes.

## Integrating Stringtale into your project

Whether you're integrating Stringtale into a new project or an existing one, the steps are the same.

1. Install the Stringtale CLI globally:
    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install -g @stringtale/cli
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="Yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn global add @stringtale/cli
        ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm install -g @stringtale/cli
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
2. Login using with your Stringtale credentials `stringtale login`
3. Run `stringtale init`, after which the CLI will go through the following steps:
    1. Offer you to select an existing Stringtale project or offer to create a new one.
    2. It will return a `STRINGTALE_PROJECT_ID`, to add to your environment variables.
    3. Automatically add `stringtaleRoute` to your routing to enable it's capabilities in your project.
    4. Offer you to automatically integrate Stringtale into your project. When accepted this means the CLI will
    attempt to wrap all static text in your project in `<Value>` tags.
4. Run your project as you normally would and open it in your browser.
5. Add the `?stringtale` query parameter to the URL and watch the magic happen.

## Getting live edit to your clients 
1. Open the [Stringtale Dashboard](https://app.stringtale.com) and select your project.
2. Go to `Project properties` and create a `API key` for your test / preview environment.
3. Deploy your updated app to your test/preview environment and add the STRINGTALE_API_KEY environment to your deployment.
4. Instruct your client to install the [Chrome extension], navigate to the preview environment and click the Stringtale
button in their toolbar.
