Looking to integrate Stringtale into your (existing) project? You've come to the right place! This guide will lead
you through the required steps and get you up and running in minutes.

## Before getting started

### Introduction of components
Understanding the different components of Stringtale up front will aid your integration. Here's a run down of the
components.


- JavaScript libraries (for integration with the front- and back-end of your project)
- Command Line Utility (CLI) (for easier integration and local usage)
- Dashboard (for creating and managing projects, users as well as billing)
- GitHub action (optional)

### How does it work once integrated?

Stringtale works as a client side JavaScript library that activates either by either adding `?stringtale` to the URL
or by enabling it through the [Chrome extension](/usage/browser-extension). When edited text gets saved, it makes
a call to the `/api/stringtale` route of your back-end, which then passes it on to Stringtale for storage. Your back-end
will then in turn call the Strintale API, authenticating using the `Deploy key`.

## Integrating Stringtale

Due to how Stringtale operates, it's required to integrate it with both the backend and the frontend of your project. We're
working on a new version where the backend is no longer required, but at this point in time that's not available.

### Integrating Stringtale on your back-end

The fastest way to get started is to use our CLI for semi-automatic integration. If you prefer to do things manually,
please refer to our documentation for your back-end framework. Both automatic as well as manual integration work for
new and existing projects. To use the CLI, follow the steps below.

1. Install the **Stringtale CLI** globally:
   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="npm">
       ```bash
         npm install -g @stringtale/cli
       ```
      </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Yarn">
       ```bash
         yarn global add @stringtale/cli
       ```
      </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pnpm">
       ```bash
         pnpm install -g @stringtale/cli
       ```
      </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
2. Login using with your Stringtale credentials `stringtale login`
3. Run `stringtale init`, and follow the prompts
   1. Select your language (Typescript or JavaScript)
   2. Select which back-end framework you use (Next.js or Express.js)
   3. Offer you to select an existing Stringtale project or offer to create a new one.
   4. Depending on your selected framework it will exexcute the following steps:

      **Next.js (both app and pages router)**
      
      1. Attempt to locate your next.config.js to detect the root of your project or
         prompt you if it can't find the correct one.
      2. Detect whether you use the App router or the pages router.
      3. Create a `stringtale.ts` file in the appropriate API folder to enable `/api/stringtale`.
      4. Add the required dependencies for your project.
      5. Write a `stringtale.config.json` to the root of your project with the configuration for the CLI.

      **Express.js**
      1. Add the required dependencies for your project.
      2. Write a `stringtale.config.json` to the root of your project with the configuration for the CLI.
      3. Instuct you to add the `/api/stringtale` route. Because of how Express handles routing, we don't add this automatically.
         ```tsx
          import express from 'express'
          import { setupRoute } from "@stringtale/express"
          const app = express()

          app.all('/api/stringtale', setupRoute({
            apiKey: process.env.STRINGTALE_API_KEY!
          }))
         ```
  5. Once `stringtale init` has finished, it's integrated with your back-end. Refer to the [React framework]() documentation to implement it with your front-end.

### Integrating Stringtale on your front-end

4. Offer you to automatically integrate Stringtale into your project. When accepted this means the CLI will
  attempt to wrap all static text in your project in `<Value>` tags.
4. Run your project and open it in your browser.
5. Add the `?stringtale` query parameter to the URL and watch the magic happen.

## Using Stringtale

## Getting live edit to your clients

1. Open the [Stringtale Dashboard](https://stringtale.com/app/projects) and select your project.
2. Go to `Project properties` and create an `API key` for your test / preview environment.
3. Deploy your updated app to your test/preview environment and add the STRINGTALE_API_KEY environment to your deployment.
4. Instruct your client to install the [Chrome extension], navigate to the preview environment and click the Stringtale
   button in their toolbar. */}
