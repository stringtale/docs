Looking to integrate Stringtale into your (existing) project? You've come to the right place! This guide will lead
you through the required steps and get you up and running in minutes.

## Before getting started

### Introduction of components
Understanding the different components of Stringtale up front will aid your integration. Here's a run down of the
components.

- JavaScript libraries (for integration with the front- and back-end of your project)
- Command Line Utility (CLI) (for easier integration and local usage)
- Dashboard (for creating and managing projects, users as well as billing)
- Utilities such as a GitHub action (optional), a Visual Studio Code extension and an ESlint plugin

### How does it work once integrated?

Stringtale works as a client side JavaScript library that activates either by either adding `?stringtale` to the URL
or by enabling it through the [Chrome extension](/usage/browser-extension). When edited text gets saved, it makes
a call to the `/api/stringtale` route of your back-end, which then passes it on to Stringtale for storage. Your back-end
will then in turn call the Stringtale API, authenticating using the `Deploy key`.

## Integrating Stringtale

Integrating Stringtale is easy. All you need to do is add an API route to your backend (which we provide) and expose it to
your codebase through the `<StringtaleProvider>`. After that you can use it anywhere in your code.

### Integrating Stringtale on your back-end

The fastest way to get started is to use our CLI for semi-automatic integration. If you prefer to do things manually,
please refer to the documentation for your back-end framework. Our automatic integration is suited for both new
and existing project. To use the CLI, follow the steps below.

1. Install the **Stringtale CLI** globally:
   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="npm">
       ```bash
         npm install -g @stringtale/cli
       ```
      </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Yarn">
       ```bash
         yarn global add @stringtale/cli
       ```
      </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pnpm">
       ```bash
         pnpm install -g @stringtale/cli
       ```
      </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
2. Login using with your Stringtale credentials `stringtale login`
3. Run `stringtale init`, and follow the prompts.
   1. Select your language (Typescript or JavaScript).
   2. Select which Stringtale project should be assigned to this project.
   3. Select which back-end framework you use (Next.js or Express.js).
   4. The CLI will then generate a `stringtale.config.json` for your project.
   5. Depending on the selected back-end the CLI will perform the following steps:
      <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Next.js (app router)">
          1. Attempt to locate your `next.config.js` to detect the root of your project or prompt you if it can't find the correct one.
          2. Create `app/api/stringtale.ts` to enable `/api/stringtale`.
          3. Add the required dependencies for your project.
          5. Instruct you to add `<StringtaleProvider>` and Stringtale's CSS to your `RootLayout` in `app/layout.tsx` as such:
              ```tsx
              import { StringtaleProvider } from "@stringtale/next"
              import "@stringtale/react/styles.css"
 
              export default async function RootLayout({
                children,
              }: {
                children: React.ReactNode
              }) {
                return (
                  <html>
                    <body>
                      <StringtaleProvider>{children}</StringtaleProvider>
                    </body>
                  </html>
                )
              }
              ```
              For more information about `RootLayout` see the [NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required).
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Next.js (pages router)">
          1. Attempt to locate your `next.config.js` to detect the root of your project or prompt you if it can't find the correct one.
          2. Create `<PROJECT_DIRECTORY>/pages/api/stringtale.ts` to enable `/api/stringtale`.
          3. Add the required dependencies for your project.
          5. It will instruct you to customize your App component in `_app.tsx` and add the `<StringtaleProvider>`
              ```tsx
              import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
              import { StringTaleProvider } from "@stringtale/next"
              import "@stringtale/react/styles.css"
 
              export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
                return (
                  <StringtaleProvider>
                    <Component {...pageProps} />
                  </StringtaleProvider>
                 )
               }
              ```
              For more information about customizing the `App` component see the [NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app).
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Express.js">
          1. Add the required dependencies for your project.
          2. Instruct you to add the `/api/stringtale` route. Because of how Express handles routing, we don't add this automatically. Example:
              ```tsx
              import express from 'express'
              import { setupRoute } from "@stringtale/express"
              const app = express()
             
              app.all('/api/stringtale', setupRoute({
                apiKey: process.env.STRINGTALE_API_KEY!
              }))
              ```
          3. Instruct you to add the `<StringtaleProvider>` with `apiRoute` attribute to App component in `app.js` / `app.tsx`. Example:
              ```tsx
              import { StringtaleProvider } from "@stringtale/react"
              import "@stringtale/react/styles.css"

              function App() {
                return (
                  <StringtaleProvider apiRoute="https://www.example.com/api/stringtale">
                    <div className="App" />
                  </StringtaleProvider>
                )
              }

              export default App
              ```
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>

  5. Once `stringtale init` has finished, it's integrated with your back-end. To start using Stringtale in your front-end,
    check out the next section.
  
### Integrating Stringtale on your front-end

In order to integrate Stringtale in your React front-end you can either start wrapping your strings manually,
or make use of our Codemod.

#### Automated wrapping using Codemod

You can wrap all the static text in your sourcecode using our Codemod utility. By running `stringtale codemod` our CLI will
automatically wrap all the static text in your codebase in `<Value>` tags and generate name attributes for them.

#### Manual wrapping

To start using Stringtale on a subset of your strings, please refer to the documentation for the [React framework](/front-end/react).

## Deploying Stringtale to your test environment

Deploying Stringtale to your test environment is very straight forward. Just deploy your application as usual, add `STRINGTALE_API_KEY` to your
environment variables and you're good to go. To obtain the `STRINGTALE_API_KEY` you can follow the steps below:
1. Go to the [Stringtale Dashboard](https://stringtale.com/app).
2. Go to [Projects](https://stringtale.com/app/projects)
3. Open the project (or click on Edit project settings) you want to deploy to your test / preview environment.
4. Scroll down to `Tokens`
5. Click on `Add Token` and create a new token
  <Image src={step24} alt="Tokens section of Stringtale project" />
6. Save the token somewhere safe, you'll need it later.
  <Image src={step25} alt="Example of a token" width="564px" />
7. Enable 'Write' permissions for the newly created token by checking the checkbox for 'Can write'.

Now you can deploy your application and add `STRINGTALE_API_KEY` to your environment variables. You can start using Stringtale by adding `?stringtale` to the URL or by using our [browser extension](/usage/browser-extension).

For more information on how to use Stringtale once you've deployed it, checkout the [workflow](/guides/workflow) documentation.

<Aside type="caution">
   It's highly recommended you lock down your test / preview environment through some form authentication (i.e. basic auth),
   as there's no user authentication for text edits in Stringtale at this moment. This means that without authentication,
   anyone would be able to edit text on your website.
