Looking to integrate Stringtale into your (existing) project? You've come to the right place! This guide will lead
you through the required steps and get you up and running in minutes.

## Before getting started

### Introduction of components
Understanding the different components of Stringtale up front will aid your integration. Here's a run down of the
components.


- JavaScript libraries (for integration with the front- and back-end of your project)
- Command Line Utility (CLI) (for easier integration and local usage)
- Dashboard (for creating and managing projects, users as well as billing)
- Utilities such as a GitHub action (optional), a Visual Studio Code extension and an ESlint plugin

### How does it work once integrated?

Stringtale works as a client side JavaScript library that activates either by either adding `?stringtale` to the URL
or by enabling it through the [Chrome extension](/usage/browser-extension). When edited text gets saved, it makes
a call to the `/api/stringtale` route of your back-end, which then passes it on to Stringtale for storage. Your back-end
will then in turn call the Strintale API, authenticating using the `Deploy key`.

## Integrating Stringtale

Integrating Stringtale is easy. All you need to do is add an API route to your backend (which we provide) and expose it to
your codebase through the `<StringtaleProvider>`. After that you can use it anywhere in your code.

### Integrating Stringtale on your back-end

The fastest way to get started is to use our CLI for semi-automatic integration. If you prefer to do things manually,
please refer to the documentation for your back-end framework. Our automatic integration is suited for both new
and existing project. To use the CLI, follow the steps below.

1. Install the **Stringtale CLI** globally:
   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="npm">
       ```bash
         npm install -g @stringtale/cli
       ```
      </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Yarn">
       ```bash
         yarn global add @stringtale/cli
       ```
      </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pnpm">
       ```bash
         pnpm install -g @stringtale/cli
       ```
      </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
2. Login using with your Stringtale credentials `stringtale login`
3. Run `stringtale init`, and follow the prompts
   1. Select your language (Typescript or JavaScript)
   2. Select which back-end framework you use (Next.js or Express.js)
   3. Offer you to select an existing Stringtale project or offer to create a new one.
   4. Depending on the framework you've selected it will execute the following steps:
      <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Next.js (app router)">
          1. Attempt to locate your next.config.js to detect the root of your project or prompt you if it can't find the correct one.
          2. Create `app/api/stringtale.ts` to enable `/api/stringtale`.
          3. Add the required dependencies for your project.
          4. Write a `stringtale.config.json` to the root of your project with the configuration for the CLI.
          5. Instruct you to add `<StringtaleProvider>` and Stringtale's CSS to your `RootLayout` in `app/layout.tsx` as such:
             ```tsx
             import { StringtaleProvider } from "@stringtale/next/client"
             import "@stringtale/react/styles.css"

             export default async function RootLayout({
               children,
             }: {
              children: React.ReactNode
             }) {
               return (
                 <html>
                   <body>
                     <StringtaleProvider>{children}</StringtaleProvider>
                   </body>
                 </html>
               )
             }
             ```
             For more information about RootLayout see the [NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required).
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Next.js (pages router)">
          1. Attempt to locate your next.config.js to detect the root of your project or prompt you if it can't find the correct one.
          2. Create `<PROJECT_DIRECTORY>/pages/api/stringtale.ts` to enable `/api/stringtale`.
          3. Add the required dependencies for your project.
          4. Write a `stringtale.config.json` to the root of your project with the configuration for the CLI.
          5. It will instruct you to customize your App component in `_app.tsx` and add the `<StringtaleProvider>`
             ```tsx
             import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
             import { StringTaleProvider } from "@stringtale/next"

             export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
               return (
                 <StringtaleProvider>
                   <Component {...pageProps} />
                 </StringtaleProvider>
                )
              }
             ```
             For more information about customizing the `App` component see the [NextJS documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app).
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Express.js">
          1. Add the required dependencies for your project.
          2. Write a `stringtale.config.json` to the root of your project with the configuration for the CLI.
          3. Instuct you to add the `/api/stringtale` route. Because of how Express handles routing, we don't add this automatically.
             ```tsx
             import express from 'express'
             import { setupRoute } from "@stringtale/express"
             const app = express()
             
             app.all('/api/stringtale', setupRoute({
               apiKey: process.env.STRINGTALE_API_KEY!
             }))
             ```
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>

  5. Once `stringtale init` has finished, it's integrated with your back-end. To start using Stringtale in your front-end,
    check out the next section.
  
### Integrating Stringtale on your front-end

In order to integrate Stringtale in your React front-end you can either start wrapping your strings manually,
or make use of our Codegen.

#### Automated wrapping using Codegen

You can wrap all the static text in your sourcecode using our Codegen utility. By running `stringtale codegen` our CLI will
automatically wrap all the static text in your codebase in `<Value>` tags and generate name attributes for them.

#### Manual wrapping

To start using Stringtale on a subset of your strings, please refer to the documentation for the [React framework](/front-end/react).
