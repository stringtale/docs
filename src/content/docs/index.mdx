Stringtale is our answer to the decades old struggle of updating static text in your websites.
The days of copy pasting text from copy docs, emails or tickets to your code are over.

## What is Stringtale?

Stringtale is a collection of libraries and tools that add live text edit capabilities to your website's test
or preview environment, without the need of having to develop a CMS. You integrate it with your web framework
of choice by wrapping your static text in special tags. Once you activate Stringtale, these tags determine
which fields become editable on your website. After a copywriter has finished making their changes, you, the developer,
can pull into your source code using the CLI locally or by letting our GitHub action create a pull request. This will
in turn automatically update all static text for you.

## Why use Stringtale?

With Stringtale you give your clients what they've always craved: an easy way to update text on their
website. Even better still, you can so without even lifting a finger. There's no need to build a CMS to manage
every single piece of text on your website, Stringtale can do this for you. Not by giving you a CMS, but
rather by adding live edit capabilities to your website. Clients can edit text right where it appears.

Once your client has made the edits they want, you can automatically pull those changes to your source code
using our CLI or you can let our GitHub action create a pull request for them the next time you commit. By doing
so you as the developer still have control over integrating those text changes into your project.
