Stringtale is our answer to the decades old struggle of updating static text in your websites.
The days of copy pasting text from copydocs, emails or tickets to your code are over.

## What is Stringtale?

Stringtale is a collection of libraries and tools that add live text edit capabilities to your website's test
or preview environment, without the need of having to develop a CMS. You integrate it with your web framework
of choice by wrapping your static text in special tags. These tags determine which fields can be edited once
Strintale is enabled on your website. After a copywriter has saved their changes you, the developer, can pull
those in locally using the CLI or by letting our Github action create a pull request, which will in turn
automatically update all static text.

## Why use Stringtale?

By using Stringtale you give your clients what they've always been craving: an easy way to update text on their
website. Even better still, you can so by barely even lifting a finger. There's no need to build a CMS to manage
each and every single piece of text on your website, Stringtale can do this for you. Not by giving you a CMS, but
rather by adding live edit capabilities to your website. Clients can edit text exactly where it appears.

Once your client has made the edits they want, you can automatically pull those changes to your source code
using our CLI or you can let our Github action create a pull request for them the next time you commit. By doing
so you as the developer still have control over integrating those text changes into your project.
