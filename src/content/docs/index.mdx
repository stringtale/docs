Stringtale is our answer to the decades old struggle of updating static text on your website(s).
Using Stringtale, the days of copy pasting text from copy docs, emails or tickets to your code are over.
Your copy writers can live edit static text in your website, our toolchain handles integrating it
into your source code, all whilst giving you, the developer, final control over deployment.

## What is Stringtale?

Stringtale is a collection of libraries and tools that enable you to add live text editing capabilities to your
website's test or preview environment, without having to develop a CMS. You integrate it with your web framework
of choice by wrapping your static text in special tags. Once you activate Stringtale, these tags determine
which fields are editable on each page. Once a copywriter has finished making their
changes, you, the developer, can pull them into your source code using the CLI locally or by letting our GitHub action
create a pull request. This will in turn automatically update all static text for you.

## Why use Stringtale?

With Stringtale you give your clients what they've always craved: an easy way to update text on their
website, right where they see it. Even better still, you can enable them to do so without even lifting
a finger. Stringtale has been build to be easily integrated into your source code and workflow. Once that's
done, your client can make all the text edits they desire.

To make things even better, once your client has made their edits, you, the developer, maintain control over
the implementation. You can either pull the changes into your source code locally using the CLI, or let our
Github Action create a pull request the next time you commit. By giving you control, you avoid text-edits
accidentally breaking the layout of your website.
