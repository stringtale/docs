import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

A reference guide for all CLI options. Note that all sub commands can be ran with the `--help` option to display more information about the command.

## Installation

You can install the CLI globally using your JavaScript package manager. Or use your package manager to run it directly.

To install globally you can use:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```bash
      npm install -g @stringtale/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn v1 / v2">
    ```bash
      yarn global add @stringtale/cli
    ```
    **Note:** Installing npm packages globally is no longer supported as of Yarn v3. See below how you can run it directly instead.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
      pnpm install -g @stringtale/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To run Stringtale directly:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm / npx">
    ```bash
      npx @stringtale/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn v3+">
    ```bash
      yarn dlx @stringtale/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```bash
      pnpm exec @stringtale/cli
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Basic usage command

You can use the Stringtale CLI as follows.

```bash
stringtale [command] [options]
```

<Aside type="tip">
  If you decide to use the CLI directly without installing, just replace `stringtale [command]` with the equivalent `packageManager @stringtale/cli [command]`.
