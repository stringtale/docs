Learn how to use the Visual Studio Code Extension.

## What does it do?

The Visual Studio Code Extension allows you to wrap your static text with `<Value>` tags automatically along with generating unique `name` attributes. It even
supports automatically wrapping variables and placing them in the format attribute of the `<Value>` tag.

## Basic usage

1. Install the Stringtale [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stringtale.stringtale) from
the Visual Studio Marketplace
2. Select the text you want to wrap in a `<Value>` tag

<Image src={step2} alt="Selected text in VS Code"  />

3. Hit `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` and exexcute `Stringtale: Wrap`

<Image src={step3} alt="VS Code Command Palette with Stringtale: Wrap selected"  />

4. The VS Code extension will generate a unique `name` attribute for the `<Value>` tag based on the filepath and offer
you to rename it. We recommend you limit renaming to new tags and not existing ones to avoid synchronization issues.

5. Once you've accepted the name, the VS Code wrap your text in a `<Value>` tag, rendering the field editable in your browser.

6. That's it! The name attribute will be used to store information once the text changes, there's no need to push
it to the server.

## Advanced usage

The demonstration above shows basic usage of how to wrap plain text with a `<Value>` tag. But the functionality of Stringtale isn't limted to just plain text. It
supports string interpolation and inline components. Below is an example of how to have the Visual Studio Code extension automatically wrap a piece of text with
a string interpolated variable.

The usage is exactly the same as the basic usage. Just select the text `Welcome: {name}` and execute the `Stringtale: Wrap` command.
```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";

const name = "John Doe"

<span>
  Welcome: {name}
</span>
```

Will automatically be transformed to:

```tsx
import { Value } from "@stringtale/react";

const name = "John Doe"

<span>
  <Value
    name="apps.web.src.index.welcome_name"
    format={{ name }}
  >
    {/* HTML */ `Welcome: {name}`}
  </Value>
</span>
```

<Aside type="note">
  The `/* HTML */ prefix is used as a hint for your IDE to handle formatting correctly. Even though it's not strictly HTML, the job done.
