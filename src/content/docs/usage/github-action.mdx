Learn how to use the Stringtale GitHub Action in your workflow.

## What does it do?

The Stringtale GitHub Action automatically creates Pull Requests in your GitHub repository with the latest text updates stored in Stringtale.

## Why use it?
The GitHub action automates the process of implementing text changes that have made by you or your client. Your team will gets notified automatically
of new Pull Requests, allowing you to see if there is an update without having to check manually.

With our GitHub action you still have full control if you want to run Stringtale on every push on every branch, or if you want to limit this
to just release branches.

## How do I use it?

### Setting up the GitHub action
You can set up the GitHub action for your repository in a couple of steps.

1. Navigate to the [Stringtale Dashboard](https://stringtale.com/app/projects) and open your project.
2. Go to `Project Settings` and create a new `Deploy token`. Copy this, as you'll need it in a moment.
3. Next, go to your GitHub repository => Settings => Environments.
4. Add the `Deploy token` as `STRINGTALE_TOKEN` to the required environment(s).
5. Create a `stringtale.yaml` file in the `.github` folder in the root of your project. For example
`<PROJECT_DIRECTORY>/.github/stringtale.yaml`.
6. Use the example YAML file from below and adjust to your project's needs.
7. The next time this workflow gets triggered Stringtale will automatically create a Pull Request with any pending changes to the branch that triggered it.

### Example yaml for GitHub actions

The example yaml file below will enable Stringtale to run on all branches on all pushes. If you prefer a different workflow, please refer
to the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).

```yaml
name: Stringtale

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - '**' # Where ** Mean all branches, * only matches every branch that doesn't contain a '/'

jobs:
  build-web:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Or i.e. ubuntu-20.04, no version requirement there
    environment: CHANGE-ME # Change this to your GitHub environment
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Run stringtale action
      uses: demonsters/stringtale-action@v0.2.14
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        # STRINGTALE_TOKEN is the Deploy Token for your project in the dashboard
        STRINGTALE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.STRINGTALE_TOKEN }}

```
