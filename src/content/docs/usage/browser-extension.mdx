The browser extension allows you to more enable Stringtale on your webpage. It avoids the paging having to reload, allowing you to make changes
to the copy of your modals (which would otherwisedisappear once the page reloads). It's also the user-friendly alternative to appending `?stringtale` to the URL

## Install and use the browser extension

1. Install the browser extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore).
2. Navigate to your project's test / preview environment. We'll use the [Stringtale website](https://stringtale.com/demo) for this guide. 
   <Image src={original} alt="Original website" />
3. Click the Stringtale button in the toolbar of your browser.
   <Image src={browserIcon} alt="Stringtale browser icon" width="199px" />
4. Stringtale will now become visible on the page
   <Image src={stringtaleMenu} alt="Save changes button" width="341px" />
5. You'll notice that something changed about the text on the page. They've now become editable textfields that allow you to alter the text of the page.
   <Image src={editableFields} alt="Editable fields" />
6. You can now make changes to the text on the page. When you hit preview, it'll display a preview of your changes without the editable textfields.
   <Image src={changedText} alt="Changed text" />
7. Once you've finished making changes, click on `Save changes` to save them to Strintale, ready for the developer to integrate with the next update.
