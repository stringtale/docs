This guide will teach you how to enable Slack notifications for text updates in your project(s).

## What does it do?

The Slack webhook will automatically send a notification to your Slack channel whenever text updates are made using Stringtale. It will send a separate notification for every key that has been updated, this will be improved in the future.

## Why use it?
The Slack webhook is a great way to stay on top of text edits in your various projects. Rather than having to check manually each time if there's a pending pull request, you get notified when the text edits have been made.

## How do I use it?

In order to use Slack Webhooks, you need to create a custom Slack app and enter it's Webhook URL into Stringtale. You can achieve this by following these steps:

1. Create a new Slack app for your Slack workspace by following the [Getting started with incoming webhooks guide](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#getting_started_with_incoming_webhooks) on Slacks API docs. Below are the individual steps and settings required.
   1. Click on `Create your Slack app`
   2. On the next step choose `From scratch`
   3. Give the app a name and select a Workspace for which you want to enable the app
   4. Once you've created the app, navigate to `Incoming Webhooks` in the menu on the left
   5. Turn on `Activate incoming webhooks`
   6. Once enabled, click on `Add new Webhook` and select the channel in which you want to receive your stringtale updates and click Allow.
2. Once you've created the Webhook, you'll get a Webhook URL which looks something like the URL below. Click copy, we need it in a few steps. 
   `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
3. Go to the [Stringtale Dashboard](https://stringtale.com/app).
4. Go to [Projects](https://stringtale.com/app/projects).
5. Open the project (or click on Edit project settings) you want to enable the Slack webhook for.
6. Scroll down to `Webhooks` and click on `Add Webhook`.
7. For type select 'Slack' and for the URL enter the Webhook URL you copied earlier.
8. From now on, anytime somebody presses 'Save changes' in Stringtale for that project, a webhook will automatically notify you in your Slack channel for every key that has been updated.
