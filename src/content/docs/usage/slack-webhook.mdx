Learn how to get notified of text updates in your Slack channel using the Slack webhook.

## What does it do?

The Slack webhook will automatically send a notification to your Slack channel whenever text updates are made in Stringtale. It's currently very rudementary in that it will send a message for every key that is updated, but this will be improved in the future.

## Why use it?
The Slack webhook is a great way to get notified of text updates in your Slack channel. This way you'll know if there are any changes without having to check them manually, which is especially useful when you work on multiple projects.

## How do I use it?

In order to use Slack Webhooks, you need to create a custom Slack app and enter it's Webhook URL into Stringtale. You can achieve this by following these steps:

1. Create a new Slack app for your workspace by following the [Getting started with incoming webhooks guide](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#getting_started_with_incoming_webhooks) on Slacks developer docs.
2. Once create, you should have a Webhook URL looking something like this:
   `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.
3. Go to the [Stringtale Dashboard](https://stringtale.com/app).
4. Go to [Projects](https://stringtale.com/app/projects).
5. Open the project (or click on Edit project settings) you want to enable the Slack webhook for.
6. Scroll down to `Webhooks` and click on `Add Webhook`.
7. For type select 'Slack' and for the URL enter the Webhook URL you copied earlier.
8. From now on, anytime somebody presses 'Save changes' in Stringtale for that project, a webhook will automatically notify you in your Slack channel for every key that has been updated.
