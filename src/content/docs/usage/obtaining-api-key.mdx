In this guide we'll go through the steps to obtain a Stringtale token. This token is used to authenticate your requests to the Stringtale API. Stringtale
API key can be either read-only or have read and write permissions. Read-only keys are used to pull in changes from Stringtale, for example using the CLI
or the GitHub action, while keys with write permissions are used to store changes in Stringtale. Write keys are typically only used when Stringtale is
deployed to a test / preview environment.

## Creating a token

1. Go to the [Stringtale Dashboard](https://stringtale.com/app).
2. Go to [Projects](https://stringtale.com/app/projects)
3. Open the project (or click on Edit project settings) you want to deploy to your test / preview environment.
4. Scroll down to `Tokens`
5. Click on `Add Token` and create a new token

6. Implement the token where it's required.

7. If required, enable the 'Can write' permission for the newly created token bychecking the checkbox for 'Can write'. This will allow the token to be used to edit text.
